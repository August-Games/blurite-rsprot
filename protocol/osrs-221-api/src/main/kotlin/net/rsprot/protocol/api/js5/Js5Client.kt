     * This means that the client will be sending out requests without the server
     * knowing the key, while it expects the data to have been encrypted, meaning

     * contain normal text that would fail any network filters, such as those
     * set by schools, this could be a way to bypass these filters by re-requesting
     * the data with it re-encrypted, meaning it won't get caught in the filters again.

     * doesn't pass the filters, too.
